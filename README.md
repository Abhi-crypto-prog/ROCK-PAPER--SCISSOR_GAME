# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR-GAME
GAME OF HAND - GESTURE CHOICES

NAME : ABHISHEK CHATTERJEE
DOMAIN : PYTHON | MODULE

Overview:
The "Rock, Paper, Scissors" project is a simple console-based game built using Python. It simulates the classic hand game where two players simultaneously form one of three shapes with their hands: rock, paper, or scissors. The game includes a computer as one of the players, which makes random choices using Python's random module. The user competes against the computer, and the game determines the winner based on the traditional rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive and fun game that allows users to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against a computer. The game is designed to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and list operations, while also introducing the use of the random module for simulating the computer's choices.

Key Activities:
User Interaction: The game starts by prompting the user to either begin the game or exit. Once the user decides to play, they are asked to select one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Computer's Choice: The computer randomly selects one of the three options using the random.choice() function.

Determine the Winner: The game compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner of each round based on the classic rules:

Rock crushes Scissors.
Scissors cuts Paper.
Paper covers Rock.
Scorekeeping: The game keeps track of the scores for both the user and the computer over five rounds. It also handles scenarios where both players choose the same option, resulting in a draw for that round.

End Game: After five rounds, the game announces the overall winner based on the scores. The user is given the option to play again or exit.

Technologies Used:
Python: The project is entirely coded in Python, making use of core concepts like loops, conditionals, and list operations.
Random Module: The random module is used to simulate the computer's decision-making process by randomly selecting one of the three game options.
Summary:
This project is a beginner-friendly Python program that provides a fun way to practice basic programming skills. It also introduces elements of game logic and user interaction in a console-based environment. The simplicity of the game makes it an excellent project for those new to Python, allowing them to grasp fundamental concepts while also creating something interactive and enjoyable.
